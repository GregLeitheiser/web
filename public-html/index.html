        <h3>The Mission</h3>
        <p>We're on a mission to change the way that the Catholic Church does software.</p>
        <p>No one can deny that the advent of the Internet has had a dramatic impact on the way we live, work, and communicate as humans. We connect though blogs, websites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and many other online tools. We send notes through email and stories in Word documents. We track our finances in spreadsheets and store our pictures in the cloud. Add to this the real-time connectivity of our smart phones and we’re connected to our communities in ways we never have been before.</p>
        <p>For the Catholic Church, this connectivity represents an unparalleled opportunity to reach out to people in need, to communicate the Gospel, and to share the Good News. It also opens new paths to building community within our parishes. We just need to learn how to leverage these technologies more adeptly.</p>
        <p>We at Servant’s Code are here to help.</p>
        <p>Servant’s Code is a community founded on the principles of Christian communal living and the exploration of modern software technologies.</p>
        <h3>Community</h3>
        <p>Servant’s Code is not a company nor a business. We are a group of top software developers, and their families, living our Christianity as fully as we know how. Taking as our inspiration the Acts of the Apostles, the Rule of St. Benedict, and the example of so great a cloud of witnesses that have gone before us, we strive to live out our vocation as sons and daughters of God in community. By incorporating daily liturgy, shared meals and social events into our daily lives in an orderly way, we structure our lives to best serve God through our service to his Church. We challenge and support each other to live holy lives, and in so doing, to live life to the full!</p>
        <p>This style of living is also part of our ministry. Christ came to set us free and to give us new life. A life fully lived, as he taught, is the surest testimony to the Good News. Our community is not an insular group of families isolated from the world. Rather, by being exemplars of communal living we aim to shine the light of Christ in the world through our love, joy, and service.</p>
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>In order to help the Church develop ever more relevant ways of interacting with the connected world, we aim to develop high-quality, easy-to-use software using the latest techniques and technologies. State of the art devOps infrastructure powers the modern UI designs to provide software that you can trust and will want to use; software that will help your parish to operate more efficiently and be more effective in your ministry. </p>
        <p>To be of as much service as possible to the Catholic community, all our software is released to the world on an open source basis (GPLv3). This provides two key benefits. First, it allows any parish or organization that wants it the right to run the software free of charge. Secondly, it allows other developers, IT support staff, or anyone else who knows how to code to join us in our mission to reshape the nature of software in the Catholic world. We feel this is the right way to create a change in how we do software as a Church.</p>
        <p>In addition, we are developing the software to be run as cloud native solutions. If this is a preferred access method for any parish, we look forward to working with you directly to help get you connected. The only costs you’ll pay are your portion of the cloud hosting costs.</p>
        <h3>Get involved</h3>

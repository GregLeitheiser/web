<p><b>1. Privacy Policy Coverage:</b> This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personal information and other information described in this policy, gathered when you are using or accessing the Services.</p>
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications ("Third Party Services"), such as Facebook or Twitter, that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ.

We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>
<p><b>2. Information Collection:</b> The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve, and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect, and/or use some of your information, including your personal information. We will only use the collected information for purposes of improving the Services.  Your information will not be sold or shared with third parties without your express consent, except that we may share the data with third parties authorized by us to provide analysis or technical services to improve the Services and your agreement with this Policy is your consent for this limited purpose.  We may collect the following types of information from our users.</p>
<p><b>(a) Account Information:</b> When you create an Account, you may be asked to provide information, such as your username, password, and email address. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account on the Services and providing personal information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you. If you access the Services using a third partyâ€™s credentials, we may automatically collect certain information, such as your name, picture, and email address. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services when we feel such information is important.

<p><b>(b) User Content:</b> Some features of the Services may allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your Account, as part of our normal backup and/or data retention policies. </p>
<p><b>(c) IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:</b> We may automatically receive and record information from your device or web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address, type of device, unique device ID, wireless mobile subscriber ISDN numbers, operating system, and cookie information.

Generally, the Services may automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure.

<p>We may use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.</p>

We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they may enable you to take advantage of additional features of the Services.</p>
<p><b>3. Information Sharing:</b> The Services may have features designed to allow you to consume information from others and to help you share information with others. As a result, some of the information generated through the Services may be shared publicly or with third parties.</p>

<p><b>5. Deletion of Account:</b> You can delete your Account. Please note that we may need to verify that you have the authority to delete the Account. If you terminate your Account, any information you provided will no longer be accessible via your Account. However, given the nature of sharing on the Services, any public activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our servers and may remain accessible to the public. In addition, deletion of your Account may not remove your information from the data on our system that is managed by your parish or diocese.  You will need to contact your parish or diocese for the removal of information from any account they control.</p>
<p><b>6. Children under 13</b></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without parental consent.
